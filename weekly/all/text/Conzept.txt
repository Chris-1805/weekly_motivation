'Weekly Motivation' has one goal and one goal only: to keep you <strong>motivated</strong> or give you motivation when you most need it. <br>
Of course it can vary whether you need motivation regarding your <em>fitness journey</em>, your <em>diet</em>, your <em>learning behavior</em>or just regular <em>motivation boosts</em>. <br>These are some big promises, but how do we keep up with them? <br><br>
Well, firstly we provide you information about your desired spot, all in one place, so you don't have to bother finding them. Our informations are based on recent studies and of course you can find the sources.
Furthermore we give you the opportunity to make calculations like BMI, how much calories you should consume and so on.
